# Image Editing Challenges

In this assignment, you will develop a series of image filters to practice and demonstrate your understanding of image processing. Each challenge level introduces new concepts and increases in complexity. You must complete at least **one** challenge from each of the following sections. I encourage you to try customizing the project a bit by e.g. focusing on one type of image (you could do "sky" images, or faces, or skin tones, or satellite images).

## Level 0 Challenges: Basic Pixel Adjustments

These challenges involve simple adjustments in pixel values. They are designed to get you familiar with manipulating pixel data.

1. **Brighten Filter**: Increase the brightness of an image by adding a fixed value to each color channel.
2. **Darken Filter**: Decrease the brightness of an image by subtracting a fixed value from each color channel.
3. **Grayscale Filter**: Convert the image to grayscale using the average method.

## Level 1 Challenges: Conditional Logic and Pixels

These challenges introduce conditional logic to your filters.

1. **Threshold Filter**: Implement a filter that sets all pixels to either black or white, depending on a brightness threshold.
2. **Invert Colors**: Create a filter that inverts the colors of the image.
3. **Sepia Tone**: Apply a sepia effect to give the image a warm, brownish tone.
4. **Posterize**: Create a filter that replaces all pixels with colors from a fixed
   palette based on proximity, creating the equivalent of e.g. a "4 color" poster.

## Level 2 Challenges: Tracking Pixel Position

These challenges involve more complex logic, requiring you to keep track of a pixelâ€™s position in the image.

1. **Border Filter**: Add a colored border to the image. The width and color of the border should be adjustable.
2. **Shape Overlay**: Add a rectangle, square, circle, spiral, or other shape "overlay" on
   top of the image, but distorting pixels within a given shape (for example, you could "brighten" a circle in the center of the image).
3. **Mirror Effect**: Create a filter that mirrors one half of the image onto the other.
4. **Pixelate Effect**: Implement a pixelation effect where each block of pixels is replaced by the average color of that block.

## Level 3 Challenges: Working with Options

These challenges involve creating filters with adjustable options, adding complexity and versatility.

1. **Blur Filter**: Implement a blur filter with adjustable blur radius.
2. **Vignette Effect**: Add a vignette effect where the edges of the photo fade to black. The radius of the effect should be adjustable.
3. **Color Shift**: Create a filter that shifts all colors in the image by a certain amount.
4. **Add Options**: Take any filter from Level 0 or Level 1 and add Options so the user can
   customize it.

## Level 4 Challenge: The Ultimate Filter

This is your ultimate challenge where you can showcase your creativity and understanding.

**Create Your Own Filter**: Develop a unique, artistic or purposeful filter. This could be anything from a complex artistic filter to an advanced image processing effect. The filter should include multiple options to adjust its behavior and appearance. You could analyze an image to pull out data, you could simplify, or you could try to take on a task such as changing the way a sky looks or enhancing people's eyes in close-ups of faces.
