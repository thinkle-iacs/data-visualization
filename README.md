# Data Visualization Project

For this project, we will be learning about how to use computers to help understand and interpret data. A huge amount of the power of computers comes from working with data, which comes in a variety of forms. Much effective computer science involves manipulating data in order to answer questions.

In this project, we will be using our programming skills to help explore data sets.

## Libraries used in this project

### Mapping Data
To map data we will be using open layers library through the [rlayers](https://mmomtchev.github.io/rlayers/) react package.

### Charting Data
To chart data, we will be using the [recharts library](https://recharts.org/)
